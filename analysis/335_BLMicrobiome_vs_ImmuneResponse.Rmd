## Baseline microbiome vs Immune response

The goal of this analysis is to describe the patients baseline microbiome vs immune response either using:

- Increases in CD4, categorized in a useful way (Delta_week48 for instance)
- Decreased in CD8, categorized in a useful way

It may be useful to try to classify patients solely on CD4/CD8/immune markers and the contrast this classification with microbiome composition

Also it is relevant to show that the baseline microbiom was NOT different between ARMs (DTG/DRVr)
